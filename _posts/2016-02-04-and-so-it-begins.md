title: And so it begins...

For those that don't know me, let me introduce myself. I'm a husband, father of 2, software developer and martial artist. I'll be primarly blogging about software development but I may slip in an occassional post on martial arts.

My career in software development started 16 years ago and I must say I love what I do. Sure, I have days where I feel like I've been beating my head against a wall trying to solve a problem but in the end it's all worth it when you see what you've created. I'm also an avid learner which I feel is a definite advantage for a developer because technology and development languages are constantly evolving and if you don't keep up you often get left behind. 

I primarily work in the .NET stack. C# is my language of choice, but I'm not adverse to other languages and have written code in JavaScript, Java, C++ and Visual Basic to name a few.

Ever since I first heard about the .NET Compiler platform known as Roslyn, I was keen to get involved as I felt that it would be an extremely good way to learn more about the language, framework and tools that I use everyday. Since it was opened up to the community, first on Codeplex and now on GitHub I have made several contributions and it is my intent to blog about some of the things that I have learnt along the way.

If you made it this far thanks and watch out for the first development related installment which will hopefully not be too far into the distant future...
